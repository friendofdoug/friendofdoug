- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @friendofdoug
- A few years ago as I was just starting to become interested in science I had the great fortune to be mentored by a man named Doug.
- He had no reason to be a mentor outside of his generous spirit and love of discussing science with all who were interested, no matter their level.
- I would come to him every few weeks with a new zany idea, which he would ponder thoughtfully and then explain how he thought it might or might not work.
- I can't emphasize enough how much more knowledgeable he was than I was. My first project idea was to make my electric bass sound like it was always plugged into an amp even while playing acoustically.
- I was a young girl and I was excited by how powerful the sound of my electric bass plugged into an amp turned all the way up made me feel. I didn't want to be hindered by the availability of an outlet to live that feeling again and again.
- Of course, any engineer could easily recognize the flaw in my plan, and Doug was a better engineer than most. But unlike many who I have since met in the science and tech world, he pondered my thought for awhile, thinking about how we could possibly make it work.
- Eventually, he explained the issue to me in very simple terms: the amount of energy that you put in it simply couldn't make the same sound, but maybe if you could make it hollow like an acoustic guitar you could get a similar sound.
- In hindsight, what I had proposed was exceptionally stupid and I cringe thinking about it now. But Doug didn't. And he still didn't, at every crazy idea I had since then he responded in the same way. Thinking about how to make it work, and explaining simply and kindly why it wouldn't if my idea was really too out there.
- The only time I remember him really disliking an idea of mine was when I proposed something very basic and that had already been done before: "What's the fun in that?"
- Doug gave me the nourishment to stay a dreamer, even when other people weren't as encouraging. He also gave me knowledge, and shared with me his thought processes which were 20x more interesting than most.
- I remember laughing at ourselves and at others, talking about our favorite TV shows, chatting as he let me take forever to make a simple measurement before we cut a piece of metal with the bandsaw.
- BBC shows seemed to be his favorite.
- He loved talking about music. He loved Cream (I thought they were boring) and Led Zeppelin (I love them, too. Just don't ask me what's my favorite song).
- Almost every time I'd see him he'd ask me if I'd been practicing my bass guitar. I'd often lamely say no, that I was too busy. I wish I wasn't.
- There was always an open invite to record music in his recording studio which he built himself.
- His patents hung on the wall outside his recording studio. My sister, mom, and I were in awe of how someone could be so creative and industrious to have so many.
- He would get pizza and practice guitar every Friday night, a routine I find admirable and aspirational as I often live far more chaotically and without any sort of routine.
- He built an extremely intricate model railroad of his hometown, which my mom and I passed through on my way to my first year of college, just a few weeks after he passed away.
- I was interested in honeybees, a project he and his partner shared, and he always left the offer open for me to go see theirs. A few years later I would study honeybees in my biology course, an experiment that lit me up and sustained my curiosity even today.
- When I left for college, he asked what I'd be studying.
- "Neuroscience." I replied.
- "Yuck! Brains?!"
- He was right. It wasn't for me.
- He shielded me from people who were less encouraging, and we'd always have fun together even when other people were being wackos.
- When my mom would come to pick me up she'd often find him outside, pacing around the parking lot and furiously chainsmoking yellow American Spirit cigarettes.
- Doug taught me what it means to hold onto your natural curiosity. How to be a mentor. How to be a friend.
- He tried to get me to stop giggling so much, a trait he would tease hurt his ears. I never have.
- Thanks to him, I've never stopped dreaming and scheming.
- I wouldn't be creating a GitHub, no matter how meager it might end up being, if it weren't for Doug.
- In a sense everything I put here will be an attempt to get closer to his shadow, to say thank you, to stay curious, to extend his legacy through curiosity and creation.
- The build season may end, but we're never done building.
- My head has remained in the clouds since I met Doug, in large part thanks to Doug.
- Thanks to Doug I know a bit more about physics, but not much. I still enjoy learning about it.
- And then often forgetting it.
- Sometimes I know why things don't work. Often I don't. 
- One thing I'll always remember is this: Whenever you can, be a mentor. Whenever you can, be a friend.
- Thank you, Doug.
- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in the biology of social insects, particularly their caste systems. Creating Alfred workflows and other productivity tools that will help make people's everyday lives better, easier, and/or more fulfilling. Creation in general.
- Bioinformatics. Using computers to learn more about nature. Live coding graphics and/or electronic music. Using computers for journalism.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning basics of creating Alfred workflows.
- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on anything that might seem interesting! I'm still learning a lot and I'd love to help however I can with any project that seems interesting and isn't ghoulish.
- üì´ How to reach me ... can you comment on here? Through comments if so.
- üòÑ Pronouns: she/her
